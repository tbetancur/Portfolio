Overview
Progressive growth is observed in key metrics (FTDs, registrations, and active players) in certain months.
GGR shows an upward trend, especially in markets such as BR and CA.
Some markets have high activity but low net revenue, which may indicate high incentive spending.

Conclusions
The business is expanding, with positive signs of acquisition and retention.
It is necessary to review markets with high volume but low profitability to optimize campaigns.
Recommendation: Focus investments on markets with a high GGR ratio per player.

Financial Analysis
In several months, the difference between Turnover and Winnings is low, which reduces the margin.
The NGR drops significantly compared to the GGR, especially in months with strong bonus issuance.
Some markets operate with negative margins due to excessive incentives or high withdrawal rates.

Conclusions
Greater control is needed in bonus and withdrawal management.
Recommendation: Implement a profitability-per-player model to limit incentives to high-value profiles.
Optimization potential in markets with high activity but low financial efficiency.

Players and bonus
The use of bonuses does not always translate into higher revenue; some markets show negative NGR despite high bonus issuance.
VIP players do not always generate higher net profitability.
There is a positive relationship in some segments between bonus issuance and GGR generated.

Conclusions
Users need to be better segmented to strategically allocate bonuses.
Recommendation: Evaluate the ROI of each type of bonus by market and adjust delivery rules.
Focus retention efforts on players who convert bonuses into real revenue.

comparison by channel
The casino channel is the most consistent in terms of GGR generation.
Live casino has high profitability per player, although with a lower user volume.
Sports has high volume, but its GGR/user is low and more dependent on bonuses.

Conclusions:
It is key to promote the live casino as a premium channel with VIP campaigns.
Recommendation: Increase investment in channels with high return per player (live, classic casino).
Consider adjusting sports promotions or restructuring your bonus model.
