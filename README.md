Project: Dropout Prediction and Cohort Analysis

I am a data analyst specializing in the iGaming industry, with expertise in extracting key insights to optimize player retention and predict behaviors. I use Machine Learning tools and data visualization to deliver strategic solutions.

Objective Predict the probability of a player leaving the platform. Analyze cohorts of players to understand retention over time.

Technologies Used 
Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, lifetimes) 
Google Colab for code development and execution Machine Learning with Random Forest Cohort analysis with retention tables.

1.2 Model Training

A Random Forest Classifier was used with 80% of data for training and 20% for testing.

1.3 Model Evaluation

Model accuracy: It was evaluated with the accuracy_score metric.
Confusion matrix: To visualize correct and incorrect predictions.
Classification report: To measure accuracy, recall and F1-score.

Results: The model performed satisfactorily in predicting dropout, allowing segmenting at-risk players and generating retention strategies.

Cohort Analysis
2.1 Cohort Definition

Players were grouped according to the month of registration and their activity in the following months was analyzed.

2.2 Creation of the Cohort Table
A cohort chart was generated with player retention over time.

2.3 Heatmap visualization

A retention heatmap was used, where:

Rows = Month of player registration.
Columns = Month of activity.
Values = % of players still active.

Results: Patterns of abandonment and key months in which players are most at risk of leaving the platform were identified. This allows us to implement personalized engagement strategies.

Conclusions and Lessons Learned

Players with higher activity and spend have a lower dropout rate, suggesting that incentivizing early engagement improves retention.
Cohort data shows a steady decline in retention, highlighting the need for loyalty campaigns at key moments.
Machine Learning models can predict with good accuracy which players are at risk of dropping out, allowing recovery strategies to be customized.
It is advisable to combine user segmentation strategies with predictive models to optimize business performance in iGaming.
